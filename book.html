                        <br><br>
                        1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour <br>
                        3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
                        2 cups granulated sugar<br>
                        1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
                        1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br>
                        1 teaspoon salt<br>
                        2 large eggs<br>

                        1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br>

                        Instructions:
                        <br><br>
                        For the Cake:
                        <br><br>

                        1.  Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
                        <br>  
                        2.  In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                        <br>
                        3. Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix on medium speed until well combined.
                        <br>
                        4. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the boiling water to the batter. Mix until smooth. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.
                        <br>
                        5. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.
                        <br>
                        6. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
                        <br>
                        7. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
                        <br><br>
                        For the Chocolate Ganache:
                        <br><br>
                        1. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Be careful not to let it boil.
                        <br>
                        2. Place the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let it sit for 2 minutes.
                        <br>
                        3. Stir the chocolate and cream together until smooth and glossy.
                        <br>
                        4. Let the ganache cool for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
                        <br><br>
                        Assembling the Cake:
                        <br><br>
                        1. Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of chocolate ganache over the top.
                        <br>
                        2. Place the second layer on top and cover the entire cake with the remaining chocolate ganache.
                        <br>
                        3. You can also decorate the cake with chocolate shavings, sprinkles, or any other toppings of your choice.
                        <br>
                        4. Allow the ganache to set before slicing and serving.

                            Instructions:
                            <br><br>
                            1. Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven according to the pie crust instructions, usually around 375°F (190°C).
                            <br>
                            2. Prepare the Crust: If using a store-bought crust, follow the package instructions for pre-baking or use a pre-baked crust if preferred.
                            <br>
                            3. Prepare Strawberries: Wash, hull, and halve the fresh strawberries.
                            <br>
                            4. Make Filling: In a bowl, mix the strawberries with sugar and cornstarch until the berries are coated evenly.
                            <br>
                            5. Assemble the Pie: Place the strawberry mixture into the pre-baked pie crust.
                            <br>
                            6. Bake: If the crust requires further baking, follow the instructions. If not, you can skip this step.
                            <br>
                            7. Chill: Allow the pie to cool, then refrigerate for a few hours to let it set.
                            <br>
                            8. Serve: Optionally, top with whipped cream before serving.
